# Test Task State Completion

Try typing `- [` and then trigger completion to see the available task states with descriptions:

- [ ] This is a regular todo
- [x] This is a completed task
- [/] This is a work in progress task
- [?] This is a question that needs clarification
- [!] This is an urgent task
- [-] This is a cancelled task

You can also use aliases:
- [X] Alias for done
- [completed] Another alias for done  
- [wip] Alias for in-progress
- [working] Another alias for in-progress
- [priority] Alias for urgent
- [critical] Another alias for urgent

## Test Completion Here

- [

When you trigger completion (usually Ctrl+Space or similar), you should see:
1. All available task states with their names
2. Descriptions of what each state means
3. Visual conceal characters if supported
4. Alias indicators for alternative values

The completion should show entries like:
- ` ` - Task state: todo - A task that needs to be completed
- `x` - Task state: done - A completed task (✅)
- `/` - Task state: in-progress - A task currently being worked on (⏳)
- `X` - Task state: done - A completed task (✅) [alias for 'x']
- etc.
