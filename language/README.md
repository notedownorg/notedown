# Notedown Flavored Markdown

Notedown Flavored Markdown (NFM) is an opinionated Markdown subset focused on readability and semantic meaning rather than rendering to HTML. It is designed to be used in text editors and tools that support Markdown, providing a clean and structured way to write notes, documentation, and other text-based content.

## Core Features

- [**Internal Links/Wikilinks**](./wikilinks.md) - Cross-reference content with `[[target]]` syntax
- [**Task Lists**](./tasks.md) - Manage tasks with customizable states beyond `[ ]` and `[x]`

## Configuration

- [**Workspace Configuration**](./configuration.md) - Customize Notedown behavior through `.notedown/settings.yaml`

## Philosophy

NFM emphasizes:
- **Semantic Structure**: Focus on meaning over presentation
- **Tool Integration**: Designed for editors, IDEs, and automation
- **Team Collaboration**: Shared conventions through workspace configuration
- **Extensibility**: Customizable to match team workflows
