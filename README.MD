# Notedown

Notedown is a collection of tooling for knowledge management (personal or otherwise) and/or note taking using Notedown Flavoured Markdown (NFM), a superset of Markdown that adds several features to make it more suitable for knowledge management. This is implemented as a parser and set of provider client libraries for various features (located in this repo) and a collection of clis, IDE plugins and a language server.

Note: The above statement is considered the project vision and each of these features are in varying degrees of completion, some are not yet started.

## Status

This project is in the early stages of development and is not yet ready for use. The parser is mostly complete but the providers are not yet fully implemented.
